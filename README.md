# JavaScript Iterators

## `.map()` [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
Write code using `.map()` to have the following input and output:

- question 1:  `getSquares` – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of their squares
  - ex: `getSquares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) => [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`

- question 2:`isDivisibleBy3` – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of booleans indicating whether each element is divisible by 3
  - ex: `isDivisibleBy3([1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]) => [false, true, false, true, false, false true]`

## `.filter()` [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
Write code using `.filter()` to have the following input and output:

- question 3: `getOdds` – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of only odd numbers
  - ex: `getOdds([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

- question 4: `getEvens` – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of only even numbers
  - ex: `getEvens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
  
- question 5: `getDivisibleBy4` – takes in an array of numbers and returns an array of only numbers that are divisible by 4
  - ex: `getDivisibleBy4([1, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13]) => [4, 8, 12]`

## `.reduce()` [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
Write code using `.reduce()` to have the following input and output:

- question 6:  `addUpAll` – add up all numbers in a given array
  - ex. `addUpAll([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) => 55` 

- question 7:  `multiplyAllNums` – multiply all numbers in a given array
  - ex. `multiplyAllNums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) => 120`
  
- question 8:  `squareAllNums` – power up all numbers in a given array
  - ex. `squareAllNums([3, 2, 3]) => 729, bc (3 ^ 2) = 9, and (9 ^ 3) = 729`

- question 9:  `addUpAllAges` – add up all the ages in an array of objects
  - ex. `addUpAllAges([{name: 'Carl', age: 30}, {name: 'Cara', age: 10}, {name: 'Carmen', age: 15}]) => 55`
